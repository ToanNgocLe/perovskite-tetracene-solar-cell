# perovskite-tetracene-solar-cell
MATLAB code simulate the effect of tetracene on perovskite solar cell
This code can be divided into 3 sections
  1) Building a irradiance of the sun
  2) Conventional perovskite solar cell temperature with time
  3) Perovskite solar cell coupled with tetracene temperature with time
  
The result is to demonstrate how tetracene with its singlet fission ability affect perovskite solar cell in term of efficiency and stability.
Efficiency is measured using how much thermalization loss and below bandgap loss between the two scenarios
Stability is measured based on how fast the change in temperature is in the 2 cases
  Main assumption is that there is only conduction between the two layers be the mode of heat dissipitation in the cell.
